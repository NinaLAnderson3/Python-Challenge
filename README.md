## Files for PyBank and PyPoll challenges
For this exercise, I created variables to hold the total vote count, percentage of votes, the name of the winner and an index to specify the name of a candidate in a list.  Lists were created to hold: the names of individual candidate, the number of votes each candidate received and the percentage of votes each candidate received.
