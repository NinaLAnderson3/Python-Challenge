## Files for PyBank and PyPoll challenges
For this exercise, I created variables to hold the total vote count, percentage of votes, the name of the winner and an index to specify the name of a candidate.  Lists were created to hold: the names of individual candidate, the number of votes each candidate received and the percentage of votes each candidate received.  The indices identify the position of the name of the candidate, votes received and percentage of vote so that the metrics can be written to the appropriate candidate's name in the output file and text.  Code was also generated to create the text file and output the results in a new file as well as within the terminal.
